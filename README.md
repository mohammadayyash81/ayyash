 A beam of light can be modelled as a wave of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. When two beams of
 light meet in space, these fields add according to the principle of superposition. At each point in space,
 the electric and magnetic fields are determined as the vector sum of the fields of the separate beams.
 If the two beams of light originate from separate sources, there is generally no fixed relationship between
 the electromagnetic oscillations in the beams. If two such light beams meet, at any instant in time there
 will be points in space where the fields add to produce a maximum field strength.
 However, the oscillations of visible light are much faster than the human eye can apprehend. Since there
 is no fixed relationship between the oscillations, a point at which there is a maximum at one instant
 may have a minimum at the next instant. The human eye averages these results and perceives a uniform
 intensity of light. However, if the two beams of light originate from the same source, there is generally
 some degree of correlation between the frequency and phase of the oscillations of the two beams. At one
 point in space the light from the beams may be continually in phase. In this case, the combined field will
 always be a maximum and a bright spot will be seen. At another point the light from the two beams may
 be continually out of phase and a minima, or dark spot, will be seen.
 Thomas Young was one of the first to design a method for producing such an interference pattern. He
 allowed a single, narrow beam of light to fall on two narrow, closely spaced slits. Opposite the slits he
 placed a viewing screen. Where the light from the two slits struck the screen, a regular pattern of dark
 and bright bands became visible. When first performed, Youngs experiment offered important evidence for
 the wave nature of light.
 Youngs slits function as a simple interferometer. If the spacing between the slits is known, the spacing of
 the maxima and minima can be used to determine the wavelength of the light. Conversely, if the wavelength
 of the light is known, the spacing of the slits could be determined from the interference patterns
